\section*{Extended Abstract}

There are many opinion dynamics models that make different assumptions about
the social influence process, but it remains unclear which assumptions are
empirically valid, or even how to validate and use opinion dynamics models
to understand empirical data \cite{Flache2017}. 
Here I apply a standard model-fitting approach to 
a particular social psychological phenomenon, ``group
polarization'' \cite{Myers1982} to demonstrate a potential way 
forward for general opinion dynamics model validation and application. 

Group polarization has sometimes been observed as a component 
component process of ``bi-polarization'' of the
sort observed in U.S. politics, for example. Group
polarization refers to the phenomenon where a group's average opinion on 
some topic often leads to greater average opinion extremity 
after the group discusses the topic, compared to pre-discussion opinions.
One approach to 
modeling group polarization is based on a model of ``persuasive arguments'', 
which seem to qualitatively explain experiments \cite{Mas2013}.
However, no work has been done to calculate key model parameters for 
behavioral experiments and persuasive arguments adds a layer of possibly
unnecessary complexity on existing opinion dynamics frameworks.

In this paper we present an alternative approach that enables direct 
model comparison to data, including the calculation of meaningful parameters.
To do this we modify an existing model of opinion dynamics developed by
\citeA{Flache2011} and further investigated by \citeA{Turner2018}. 
% The only
% modification is the introduction of two model parameters which will represent
% the strength of negative influence and the stubbornness of extreme opinions.
% The results are the calculation of these parameters for a number of 
% experimental settings using published research data to initialize our models
% and fit the free parameters that determine optimal model outcomes found by
% minimizing an error term over parameter space. 
Our results will partly 
support the claim by \citeA{Mas2013} that negative influence is not necessary
for group polarization. However, our results also show that persuasive arguments
and homophily are not necessary for group polarization, as MÃ¤s and Flache
assumed.  Furthermore, our method can be applied broadly to validate model assumptions 
and calculate model parameters for empirical studies.

For this preliminary work, we focus on modeling two empirical studies with
fairly clear experimental setups and results. 
The first is a study of changes in racial attitudes among
discussants in three groups who scored high, medium, or low on a racial prejudice
pre-test \cite{Myers1970}. The second study examined shifts to more conservative
or liberal views about feminism among discussants who were separated at the outset 
into ``chauvinist'' or ``feminist'' groups based on their initial responses to
a questionnaire \cite{Myers1975a}. 
% In the first experiment, there were four
% discussants per group, and in the second experiment, there were between 22 
% in the chauvinist group and 26 in the feminist group. 
The opinion scale in 
the first experiment was a nine-point scale, from -8 to +8 with -8 indicating 
```white racism' is not responsible'' for bad conditions for African-Americans
in US cities, and +8 indicates certainty that ``white racism'' is responsible.
The opinion scale in the second study is a seven-point scale ranging from -3,
indicating maximally conservative views on feminism, and +3 representing
maximally liberal views on feminism, as determined through a six-item
questionnaire. 
% To obtain our computational results, these scores are scaled to
% lie between -1 and 1. When we calculate means, we first bin respondent scores
% into one of nine or seven bins, assign the appropriate categorical score, 
% and then calculate the mean. In the nine-point scale, for example, if the
% opinion fell between $\pm \frac{1}{18}$, this opinion would be given a zero;
% if the opinion were between -1 and $-1 + \frac{1}{9}$, the opinion would be
% -8, and so on. The data for these studies and selected experimental conditions
% are given in Table~\ref{tab:results} along with the results of model-fitting
% to parameterize our model for each individual condition.

% \end{itemize}

In the model of \citeA{Flache2011},
agent $i$'s opinion on cultural issue $k$ at time $t$, $s_{ik,t}$, 
is given by $s_{ij,t} = s_{ij,t-1} + \Delta s_{ij,t} \left ( 1 - |s_{ij,t-1}| \right )$.
$\Delta s_{ij,t}$ is determined through weighted social influence. Opinions on
each cultural issue are bounded arbitrarily between -1 and 1. Leaving aside
many details for now, we propose that we can modulate the relative attractiveness
of extreme opinions by adding a parameter, $\alpha$, to the update equation
to make it 
\[
  s_{ij,t} = s_{ij,t-1} + \Delta s_{ij,t} \left ( 1 - |s_{ij,t-1}|^{\alpha} \right ).
\]
There are a number of theoretical reasons to assume that, after interaction,
agents would update their opinions to be more extreme, such as the most
extreme opinions typically being the most convincing.
%and individuals
% being more comfortable taking on and expressing more extreme opinions if 
% they know they have the social support of others with extreme opinions. 

We obtain our results by calculating $\alpha$ for five different experimental
conditions from the two studies introduced above. With $\delta_{obs}$ being
the observed mean opinion shift in each experimental condition and 
$\delta_{calc}(\alpha)$ being the calculated opinion shift, which is assumed to
be a function of $\alpha$, we calcualte the best-fit $\alpha$ as the $\alpha$
that minimizes the squared error, i.e.\
\[
  \argmin_{\alpha} \left( \delta_{obs} - \delta_{calc}(\alpha) \right )^2.
\]
The results of this model fitting for all five experimental conditions are
given in Table~\ref{tab:results}.

Our approach reinforces the difference between a model \emph{reproducing} an 
empirical result and \emph{explaining} an empirical result. In this approach, we
explain observed group polarization by calculating a key parameter that best fits
the model to observations. This is an improvement over existing methods
for opinion dynamics model validation that tends to compare qualitative 
model behavior with observations. This informs opinion dynamics modeling more
generally since it highlights the fact that different groups behave differently
in different situations. Typically in opinion dynamics models, parameters are
set to fixed values and simulations are run until the dynamics settle. In the
real-world, though, people are heterogeneous, 
interactions are finite in time, and systems do not reach
static equilibrium. Our study shows how parameter values can be inferred and
used to understand opinion dynamics in realistic systems of social influence. 

% Positive assimilation,
% where agents become more alike in opinion after interaction, occurs when the
% Manhattan distance between opinions is less than 1. Negative assimilation 
% occurs when the distance is greater than 1. With $d_{ij,t}$ as the Manhattan distance
% between opinion vector $i$ and $j$, the force of this attraction (positive
% assimilation) or repulsion (negative assimilation) scales as $w_{ij,t} = 1 - d_{ij,t}$.
% This incorporates ``biased assimilation'' where more similar opinions are
% more attractive and more dissimlar opinions are more repulsive. 


% We propose a modification with the addition of a parameter that measures the
% effect of in-group versus out-group bias, where group membership is determined
% by opinion distance \cite{Blau1977}. For this operationalization of 
% categorization effect, the parameter will be $\gamma$ and introduced as a power 
% in the weighting function, $w_{ij,t} = (1 - d_{ij,t})^\gamma$---(BUT SHOULD IT
% BE $1/\gamma$ and switch the following explanation???)
% Since $|w_{ij,t}| \leq 1$, lesser $\gamma$ will amplify
% the influence of less extreme opponents and less agreeable allies, 
% and greater $\gamma$ will attenuate the influence of less extreme opponents and less 
% agreeable allies. 

% By running models with either $\alpha$ and/or $\gamma$ as parameters to be fit,
% we can run specific instances of the models with some $(\alpha, \gamma)$ pair,
% compare the outcome measure of shift from initial mean to final mean opinion,
% and update the parameters to find the best fit between the shift observed
% empirically and the shift observed in the averaged model runs. Using a 
% gradient descent method we can find the $(\alpha, \gamma)$ combination that
% produces the best fit to empirical results. For these experiments we set the
% network to be (-TBD-).

% (DISCUSSION 2-3 par)
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Zoom out. How does this impact the larger project not just of validating
%     the assumptions of opinion dynamics models but also using them as models
%     for data analysis?
%   \item How can this approach be applied to other empirical data sources and
%     other components/levels of opinion dynamics assumptions/outcomes?
%     E.g.\ \emph{we believe this approach could be valuable to apply to multiple levels 
%     of opinion dynamics, from cognitive assumptions to the outcome variable of
%     the distribution of opinions of the population.} Follow up with two examples:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item Neuro-level validation of assimilation and homophily assumptions (ir-neuro).
%       \item Population-level outcomes as illustrated in \citeA{Mason2018}.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item Connection to ``persuasive arguments theory'', bounded confidence. 
%     Neuro evidence supports minimal group paradigm as really affecting
%     neural activity \cite{Cikara2014}, rebutting concerns that studies using
%     that paradigm that found negative influence were flawed due to temporary
%     nature of minimal groups \cite{Krizan2007,Mas2013}.
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item Compare to computational model in \citeA{Bishop1974}.
%       \item Bounded confidence seems to not have a mechanism for group
%         polarization among interacting agents---they will always settle to
%         the average of the group (proof somewhere?)
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item Using mean-field methods to calculate dynamics for any given $\alpha$
%     and $\gamma$ so this CPU-expensive matched filtering isn't used.
