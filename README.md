# group-polarization
Code for modeling component of group polarization project presented CogSci 2020 and IC2S2 2020.

## Navigation

Currently the best way to see how we got the results presented in our 
[Cog Sci 2020 proceedings paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342153646_Stubborn_extremism_as_a_potential_pathway_to_group_polarization) 
is to start in the [`notebooks/`](/notebooks) directory. 
The two notebooks there generate the data presented in both the papers and talks. From there, follow the
function calls to see how model dynamics and computational experiments are implemented.

The model is based on [Flache and Macy's 2011 model in the _Journal
of Mathematical Sociology_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0022250X.2010.532261), which was used for our [2018 paper on polarization in
_Complexity_](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/2740959/).

Please excuse the currently poor state of the documentation; furthermore the code badly
needs some refactoring. I so far just yanked code out from the repo for the 2018 _Complexity_ project
and have not gotten rid of unused code. For more information please open an issue to 
ask a question, or [send me a message](mailto:mturner8@ucmerced.edu).
